the design is not bad at all but i would love to pick a perfect colors to make the app professionally, also the logo should be bigger and showing more clearly 
focus on translate the app to Arabic fully 
add dark and light theme and make the default as the system    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sign up errors: there's no need to +963 cuz all users are Syrian, also the place of account type should be up the name and should be as section ( do not delete the account features section cuz it so cool)
sign in errors: remember me bottom is not working and not even showing, the sign in using google and Facebook is not working ( i didn't know how to make it work on supabase) also it useless since it's not available on signup 
forget the password errors : there something wrong here double check it and check the logic of it

7- /driver/trips error falid to fitch 
8- notificion buttom not working when i click on it 
9- the app show api of supabase for users on console of the browser!!
10- the app show a flex continer "bulid by scout" in all pages (delete it)
11- there is no verfiticon from the driver ( the driver after he create the account he should send a verification info and files(or photos) to verification that he is driver and the after he fill the form it show him to wait until support accept it, if support (on our case admin) accept the driver verfiticon, if not the profile of driver is frizzing, and if the driver didn't send the verification info after 1 week of creating account the account will be frizzing too
it is importint that it show to him and remember the driver to do verification until he send the info and after the send it show pending and whem he got accept it turn ti approve until the driver click ok to confirm he see that accepted.
